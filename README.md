This program should be pretty self explanable. However, in case F, I use
a modification of BFS to traverse the matrix. When I finished I saw that
you wanted several commits. Im sorry about that. I simply setup the when
statements and wrote each case, starting from top to bottom. In the end
I added the argument warning because it was so easy to forget exactly
how the input should be.

To run this program, simply run
irb -r ./carwow.rb
no instruction were written since we assume the user has the problem
sheet given.
